# Lab Report Assistant

An AI assistant that turns a patient's lab results into a plain-language report a physician approves. Claude drafts it; code checks every number, unit and range against the lab data and refuses anything that reads as a diagnosis; the approved text is delivered once; every step is in an append-only audit log.

**Status:** research and brief done; the spec is being decided (`docs/product/spec.md`). No code yet.

Made-up clinic, made-up patients: this repository contains no real patient data and names no real company.
